# College-Project3

This project taught me the importance of, and how to, code securely.

The client for this project is a consulting company that develops individual financial plans for their customers. They have a RESTful web API setup and were looking for assistance protecting themselves from external threats.

During this project, I added multiple layers of security through the use of an algorithm cipher, generating certificates, using an HTTPS protocol, and manually reviewing/updating the code. The decision of what mitigation techniques to use is different for every project and should come from a dependency check and manual review of the code.

I got more familiar with the Eclipse IDE for Java and the Maven dependency check plugin during my work on this project, which will prove to be beneficial in the future. Learning how to generate a SHA-256 cipher was also a useful skill that could be used in future work.
