# College-Project3

This project taught me how to code securely and the importance of doing so.

The client for this project is a consulting company that develops individual financial plans for their customers. They have a RESTful web API setup and were looking for assistance protecting themselves from external threats.

During this project, I added multiple layers of security through the use of an algorithm cipher, generating certificates, using an HTTPS protocol, and manually reviewing/updating the code. The decision of what mitigation techniques to use is different for every project and should come from a dependency check and manual review of the code.

I got more familiar with the Eclipse IDE for Java and the Maven dependency check plugin during my work on this project, as well as how to generate a SHA-256 cipher, which could all be helpful for future work.
